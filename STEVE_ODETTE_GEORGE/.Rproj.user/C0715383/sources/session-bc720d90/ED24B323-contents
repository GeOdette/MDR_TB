\# Let us get a summary of the data to help provide a leading research question

summary(epidemiology_df)

\# From the summary:

\# - There are missing values that will need to be addressed before further analysis. These include:

\# 11 missing values in the acute malnutrition column

\# 19 missing values in the Stunted Children (6-23 months) column

\# 355 missing values in the Diarrhoea Cases

\# Missing values in the underweight columns

\# In removing the missing values:

epidemiology_df1 \<- na.omit(epidemiology_df)

summary(epidemiology_df1)

\# Based on the above summary:

\# There seem to be a wide variation in the number of children dewormed; from a in of 616, to a max of 392800, anda mean of 13014.

\# This points to a large variation accross counties and time periods

\# There seem to be a possible wide variation in children with acute mulnutrition, from 1 to over 4,000, with an average of around 125.

\# Clearly, some counties have higher levels/rates of accute mulnutrition than others. Some time periods as well

\# Similar patterns as seen above have been replicated in number of stunted, underweight and diarrhea cases.

\# Based on these eagles eyeview;

\# Primary question: What is the trend in the number of children \<5 years with acute malnutrition across Kenyan counties from January 2021 to June 2023?

\# Rationale: If acute malnutrition is a significant problem in Kenya and policy and interventions are governmnent priorities:

\# We can identify hotspots for acute mulnutrition and put more efforts there.

\# Secondary question:What is the trend in the number of children \<5 years dewormed across Kenyan counties from January 2021 to June 2023?

\# And if the primary question is coupled with the secondary question, we can judge to what extent do we need to go with the access to deworming?

#\-\-\-\--EDA\-\-\--

\# Let us get a sneak peak of how the variables play per county first

dewormed_bar \<- ggplot(epidemiology_df1, aes(x = Acute.Malnutrition, y = county)) +

geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +

xlab("Total Dewormed") +

ylab("County") +

theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +

ggtitle("Total Dewormed per County")

dewormed_bar

\# NOTES: Bomet, kisii, Bungoma, Baringo, Nyamira, Nyandarua, Siaya, Taita Taveta, and Uasin Gishu counties deworm the least while Wajir county deworm the most.

mulnutrition_bar \<- ggplot(epidemiology_df1, aes(x = Acute.Malnutrition, y = county)) +

geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +

xlab("Acute malnutrition") +

ylab("County") +

theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +

ggtitle("Cases of acute mulnutrition per County")

mulnutrition_bar

\# NOTES: We have more cases of acute malnutrition in Wajir county with significantly few cases in counties that deworm the least

diarhe_bar \<- ggplot(epidemiology_df1, aes(x = diarrhoea.cases, y = county)) +

geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +

xlab("Diarrhoea cases") +

ylab("County") +

theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +

ggtitle("Cases of diarrhoea per County")

diarhe_bar

\# NOTES: We have more cases of diarrhea in Nairobi, county. Other leading counties are Turkana, Nakuru, Kilifi, and Mandera. Nairobi appeared to have a moderate rate of deworming.

\# Counties that had lower rates of deworming have relatively lower rates of diarrhoea.

epidemiology_df1

\# HOW IS STUNTED GROWTH DISTRIBUTED ACCROSS THE COUNTIES?

stunted_data \<- epidemiology_df1 %\>%

select(county, stunted.0..6.months, stunted.6.23.months, stunted.24.59.months)

stunted_data_long \<- stunted_data %\>%

gather(age_group, value, -county)

ggplot(stunted_data_long, aes(x = value, y = county, fill = age_group)) +

geom_bar(stat = "identity") +

xlab("County") +

ylab("Number of Stunted Children") +

theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +

ggtitle("Distribution of Stunted Growth Across Age Groups per County") +

scale_fill_manual(values = c("#f9a8a8", "#f3cd6a", "#9fcc8e"),

labels = c("0-6 months", "6-23 months", "24-59 months"))

\# NOTES: There variations in how ages groups have a stunted growth accross the counties. In Nairobi (had the highest rates of diarrhea), for instance, the rates of stunted growth

\# is high among those aged 24-59 months than 0-6 months, or 6-23 months. In Wajir county (had the highest rates of deworming, malnutrition), the highest rates of stunted growth are among those aged 6-23 months.

\# Nontheless, in most counties, there are higher rates of studented growth among children aged 24-59 months; this should be carefully noted for government interventions or additional studies

\# HOW ABOUT UNDERWEIGHT

underweight_data \<- epidemiology_df1 %\>%

select(county, Underweight.0..6.months, Underweight.6.23.months, Underweight.24.59.Months)

stunted_data_long \<- stunted_data %\>%

gather(age_group, value, -county)

ggplot(stunted_data_long, aes(x = value, y = county, fill = age_group)) +

geom_bar(stat = "identity") +

xlab("County") +

ylab("Number of Stunted Children") +

theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +

ggtitle("Distribution of Underweight Across Age Groups per County") +

scale_fill_manual(values = c("#ff7f00", "#1f78b4", "#33a02c"),

labels = c("0-6 months", "6-23 months", "24-59 months"))

underweight_data

\# NOTES: A similar distribition as seen in stunted growth is depicted in underweight. More children aged 25-59 months are underweight compared to others

\# The case in Wajir is the same as seen in stunted growth.
