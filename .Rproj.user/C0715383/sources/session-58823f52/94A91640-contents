## Background of information

-   Tuberculosis (TB) is a deadly infectious disease, claiming over 1.6 million lives annually (WHO, 2022)

-   Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) poses a significant challenge globally, being resistant to key anti-TB drugs[^1] (WHO, 2022)

[^1]: Isoniazid and Rifampicin

<!-- -->

-   Global MDR-TB cases increased by 3.2% to 450,000 in 2022 (WHO, 2022; Salari et al., 2023)

-   East Africa has an MDR-TB estimate of 4% among newly diagnosed and 21% among previously treated individuals (Molla et al., 2022)

-   Kenya, a high-TB burden country, had an estimated 5% MDR-TB prevalence in 2018 (Kerubo et al., 2022)

## Background of information cont.

-   MDR-TB imposes significant economic burdens, costing more to manage and affecting productivity[^2] (Ministry of Health Kenya, 2017; Kairu et al., 2021; Silva et al., 2021)

-   Kenya lacks comprehensive epidemiological data on MDR-TB, especially from the National TB reference laboratory (NTRL) (Gichuki & Mategula, 2021)

-   Molecular diagnostic tests like Xpert MTB/RIFÂ® and LPA have increased MDR-TB detection accuracy (Aricha et al., 2019)

-   However, since 2015, Kenya lacked MDR-TB surveillance using NTRL data

[^2]: Ksh. 145,109.53 compared to Ksh. 25,874.00 for drug-susceptible TB in 2017 (Ministry of Health Kenya., 2017)

## Background of information cont.

-   This study aims to comprehensively examine the epidemiology of MDR-TB in Kenya from 2015-2016, filling gaps in existing knowledge

-   A retrospective cross-sectional study will analyze epidemiological and molecular data from the NTRL to identify trends and patterns of drug resistance

-   The findings will aid targeted interventions like contact tracing and infection control measures based on transmission dynamics identified through genomic analysis

## Research questions

What is the molecular epidemiology of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis based on isolates receieved at the NTRL:

::: incremental
::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
-   What is the prevalence and phenotypic profiles of MDR isolates at NTRL?
:::

-   What are the gene mutations conferring MDR in isolates at the NTRL?

-   Which gene mutations co-exist to confer MDR in isolates at the NTRL?

-   What is the genetic diversity of MDR isolates at the NTRL?

## Objectives

**General objective**

To characterize multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) isolates from the National TB Reference Laboratory using whole-genome sequencing

## Objectives

**General objective**

To characterize multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) isolates from the National TB Reference Laboratory using whole-genome sequencing

Specific objectives

::: incremental
::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
-   To determine the prevalence and phenotypic profiles of multi-drug-resistant *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* among TB samples from the NTRL
:::

-   To determine the mutations conferring drug resistance within drug target genes of the sequenced MDR isolates, their frequency, and distribution

-   To determine the genetic diversity of MDR TB isolates from NTRL by Whole Genome Sequencing

-   To evaluate co-existent gene mutations, their frequency, and distribution of isolates at the NTRL

## Workflow

OK

## Methods

-   Retrospective cross-sectional study investigating MDR-TB epidemiology using NTRL samples in Nairobi

-   NTRL: Central repository for TB data, collecting nationwide information

-   Data from 2015-2016, including all confirmed pulmonary TB cases entered into LIMS, were eligible

-   Table 1: Laboratory procedures for diagnosing drug-resistant TB at NTRL in 2015

-   Table 2: Variables available for 2015-2016 data, with 8308 entries analyzed

## Methods cont.

Data Analysis - pDST Arm

-   Initial analysis using pDST data, dropping nulls to proceed with 1271 entries

-   76 entries fit MDR definition and included in downstream analysis

## Methods cont.

Data Analysis - Analysis and Regression Model

-   LPA data analysis: After removing nulls, 2621 entries remained

-   Only verified MDR entries with full demographic data were included, resulting in 143 MDR cases

-   R and R packages used for data analysis and visualizations

-   Prevalence of MDR calculated by dividing MDR entries by total entries

-   Statistical tests (Fisher's Exact Test, Wilcoxon rank sum test) with q-value correction used where applicable

-   Logistic regression model with gender and type of TB patient as variables

## RESULTS

Demographic Summary

-   Our study analyzed 1271 entries with pDST data (15% of 8308)

-   MDR prevalence based on pDST data: 5.97% (76/1271)

-   Males accounted for 62% of MDR cases, while females were 29%

-   50% of MDR cases were HIV negative, 16% were HIV positive, and 22% had no HIV test

-   Different TB patient categories were identified, with new TB patients and those on retreatment being the highest percentages

# Results: Age distribution

-   The mean age of the study population was 33 years

-   Ages ranged between 0 and 62 years

-   As depicted in Figure 2, fewer MDR-TB cases were observed among those aged between 55-64[^3]

-   Similarly, the age groups of 0-4 and 5-14 exhibited lower prevalence rates[^4]

[^4]: 3.9% (3/76; 95% CI 1.0%, 12%) and 2.6% (2/76; 95% CI 0.46%, 10%) respectively
